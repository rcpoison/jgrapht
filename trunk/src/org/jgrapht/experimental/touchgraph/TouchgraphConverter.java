     * Convert a JGraphT graph to the representation used in the TouchGraph library.
     * 
     * http://sourceforge.net/projects/touchgraph
     *
     * TouchGraph doesn't have a sensible, extensible graph object class and so one has to
     * add them to a TGPanel which will store the graph components (the set of nodes and edges) in its own way.
     * The closest Touchgraph has to a graph object is a GraphEltSet but Touchgraph does not provide the visibility
     * to use it easily and one can use a JGraphT graph. 
     * 
     * While JGraphT nodes can be any type of objects, TouchGraph uses a set of 
     * com.touchgraph.graphlayout.Node and com.touchgraph.graphlayout.Edge only. Moreover, TouchGraph edges are always directed.
     * Having said that, if you want a nice way to visualize and explore a graph, especially large complex graphs, TouchGraph is very nice
     * 
     * @param graph: the JGraphT graph
     * @param tgPanel: the TouchGraph TGPanel 
     * @param selfReferencesAllowed: do you want to include self-referenctial edges, ie an edge from a node to itself?
     * Self-referential loops do not show up in the TG visualization but you may want to subclass TG's Node class to show them
     * @throws TGException
     * @return first node of the TouchGraph graph
