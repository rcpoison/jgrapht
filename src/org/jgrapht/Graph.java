/**
 * The root interface in the graph hierarchy.  A mathematical graph-theory
 * graph object <tt>G(V,E)</tt> contains a set <tt>V</tt> of vertices and a set
 * <tt>E</tt> of edges. Each edge e=(v1,v2) in E connects vertex v1 to vertex
 * v2. for more information about graphs and their related definitions see <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html</a>.
 *
 * <p>This library generally follows the terminology found at: <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html</a>. Implementation of
 * this interface can provide simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs etc. The
 * package <code>org.jgrapht.graph</code> provides a gallery of abstract
 * and concrete graph implementations.</p>
 *
 * <p>This library works best when vertices represent arbitrary objects and
 * edges represent the relationships between them.  Vertex and edge instances
 * may be shared by more than one graph.</p>
 *
 * Through generics, a graph can be typed to specific classes for vertices
 * <code>V</code> and edges <code>E&lt;T&gt;</code>. Such a graph can contain
 * vertices of type <code>V</code> and all sub-types and Edges of type <code>E</code>
 * and all sub-types.
