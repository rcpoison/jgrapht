/**
 * An edge used with graph objects. This is the root interface in the edge
 * hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: the source and target associations of an Edge must be immutable
 * after construction for all implementations.  The reason is that once an Edge
 * is added to a Graph, the Graph representation may be optimized via internal
 * indexing data structures; if the Edge associations were to change, these
 * structures would be corrupted.  However, other properties of an edge (such
 * as weight or label) may be mutable, although this still requires caution:
 * changes to Edges shared by multiple Graphs may not always be desired, and
 * indexing mechanisms for these properties may require a change notification
 * mechanism.</p>
